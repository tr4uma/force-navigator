# Salesforce Navigator

This extension helps you get to any salesforce page quickly. Just type in what you need to do.

- All objects' list views and create new pages are available (even for objects that don't have tabs). Type in "List <Object Name>" or "New <Object Name>"

- All setup links are available -- Type in "Setup" to see all. For example, if you want to get to the Account fields setup, type in "Account Fields". Or any custom object setup page, type "setup <Custom Object Name>"

- (beta) Thanks to the SF tooling API, you can now create fields. "cf Account newField TEXT 100."
